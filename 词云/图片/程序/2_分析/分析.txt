Let‚Äôs put  ‚Äòflu vs #COVID19 argument to bed (in England).This @ONS graph shows five year averages. The pandemic 1Jan to 1Aug20 ‚Äúcaused‚Äù an extra 1% deaths in +85y/o‚Äôs above flu. Actual flu deaths are 0.5% less than 5 year trend. It drops away massively in younger (1/3) https://t.co/jTwIUna99z
.... populations, so much so, averages for under 65 aren‚Äôt visible.Conclusions are, flu, even with vaccines kills old people seasonally, every year. As it has killed 0.5% less this year, realistically assume #COVID19 got there first. (2/3)

I'm no expert but I do not believe any of these #COVID19 restrictions are fully effective, I'm wondering is there is a method of transmission that yet to be discovered, which has been hinted at by #PresidentMacron of #France.
If #COVIDUK figures &amp; forecasts are so bad, why on earth is @10DowningStreet waiting 5 days until Thursday to implement #Lockdown2Appreciate some businesses, organisations &amp; individuals may need a working day to make adjustments, but surely Tuesday would be a realistic target https://t.co/t93vVgbKtf

@AllantonInn @Giacopazzis @yooraneejit @Douglas4Moray @John2Win @Rachael2Win Just about everyone has some cross to bear in this pandemic. The pain isn't just financial.

'In terms of deaths over the winter there‚Äôs the potential for this to be twice as bad, or more, compared to the first wave.' - Sir Patrick Vallance, chief scientific adviser. #coronavirus #covidbriefing
Boris hiding bad news while everyone is watching their Acca's, wondering whether to cash out...... coward. https://t.co/7zTMTPqZse
Am I the only person who thinks that @michaelgove is the most likely person to have leaked about the meeting with himself, @BorisJohnson, @MattHancock &amp; @RishiSunak to @thetimes and @DailyMailUK.The article made Gove sound like an advocate for lockdown!https://t.co/TQ2kb12kYI
@uk_domain_names We PCR test (if we can get the system working) but PCR tests just throw up false negatives after 15 days. So we need a double test.  A combined coronavirus / antibody test.
@uk_domain_names We need to test before people can go back to work. Specifically frontline medical and care staff need to have the neutralising antibody test created by UK RTC. This tests that they have the specific anti bodies that kill coronavirus- not every body gets them.

@PaulEmbery @Rob_Kimbell You are quite right @PaulEmbery . The people who will sadly die from Covid-19 during Autumn and Winter would of possibly died from the flue any way. It is just the way it is. Protect the vulnerable and let the rest carry on living.
@bianchibully @EssexPR Don't forget about Covid-19 preventing people from getting the flu. It is a miracle that no one will die from the flue this Autumn or Winter, as they will go done as Covid-19 deaths.

@DPJHodges The hope is that after four weeks the number of new #Covid19 cases daily will be down by 50%, - we will then return to our current tier system, under which they have been doubling every two weeks.So in six weeks' time we will be back to EXACTLY where we are now.Am I wrong?

Scotland, Wales, and Northern Ireland have had to make #covid19 decisions hampered by a Government in England which has ignored scientific advice and failed to provide adequate funding when it was required. The same can also be said about the North of England. #Lockdown2 https://t.co/f7ioy6miQ9

Now the Westminster Government has finally decided to take #COVID19 more seriously and extend Furlough scheme, there's an argument for at least some areas in Scotland to tighten up, even for a week or so.But this financial flexibility should have been there when it was needed.

There are currently 1,275 covid-related patients in Welsh hospitals ‚Äì this is 18% higher than last week and the highest number since late April. One in six people in hospital beds are there because of coronavirus. This is now only 9% lower than the peak we saw in April.
There are currently 57 people being treated in critical care for coronavirus ‚Äì 12% higher than last week. About a third of our critical care capacity is now being used for coronavirus patients.
Our normal critical care capacity of 152 beds is full, mainly with people who do not have coronavirus ‚Äì there are currently have 163 people in critical care at the moment.
They estimate nearly 16,000 people have been discharged from hospital after being treated for coronavirus since the pandemic started.
Around 90 people with COVID-19 are currently being admitted to hospital each day. Hospital transmission rates in Wales have increased over the last two to three weeks.
Despite hospital transmissions, over 85% of our available beds do not have coronavirus patients, so care remains safe for the vast majority needing to access hospital.

The research delivery team @UHNM_NHS have had a challenging few weeks with staff shortages related to COVID19 since 1 Oct the department has seen our team recruit22 patients to #RECOVERY trial16 patients to @remap_cap 35 patients to @GenomiccStudy 5 patients to #STOPCOVID
2 patients to #FALCON 53 staff to #SIREN&amp; 505 sets of crucial clinical data to the @CCPUKstudy Phenomenal numbers providing much needed data to aid our understanding of #Covid19 at same time so many people and families affected Stay Home Save Lives
